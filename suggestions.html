      <h2>Few Suggestions from our side on different crops..</h2>
      <br>
      <div>
        <br>
        <h4>RICE:</h4>
        <h6>Grown mostly in Kharif and Rabi Seasons</h6>
        <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='rice.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
           <p>* It is the staple food crop of a majority of
            the people in India. Our country is the second
            largest producer of rice in the world after China.<br>
            * It is a kharif crop which requires high
            temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity
            with annual rainfall above 100 cm. <br>* Rice is grown under so diverse soil and climatic conditions that it is said that there is hardly any type of soil in which it can not be grown including alkaline and acidic soils.</p><br><br>
            <h4>WHEAT:</h4>
            <h6>Grown mostly in Rabi Season</h6>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='wheat.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
               <p> * This is the second most important
                cereal crop. It is the main food crop, in north
                and north-western part of the country.<br> * This
                rabi crop requires a cool growing season and
                a bright sunshine at the time of ripening.<br> * It
                requires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenlydistributed over the growing season.</p><br><br>
            <h4>MILLETS:</h4><h5>Jowar,Bajra and Ragi</h5>
             <h6>Grown mostly in Kharif and Rabi Season</h6>
                   <p>* Jowar, bajra and ragi are the
                    important millets grown in India. Though,
                    these are known as coarse grains, they have
                    very high nutritional value. 
                    *For example, ragi is very rich in iron, calcium, other micro
                    nutrients and roughage. </p>
                    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='jowar.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                    <p><h6>*Jowar:</h6> is the third
                    most important food crop with respect to area
                    and production. It is a rain-fed crop mostly
                    grown in the moist areas which hardly needs
                    irrigation.<br><br></p>
                    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='bajra.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                    <p><h6>*Bajra:</h6>Bajra grows well on sandy soils and shallow
                    black soil.</p>
                    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='ragi.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                    <p><h6>*Ragi:</h6>Bajra grows well on sandy soils and shallow
                    black soil.</p>
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h4>MAIZE:</h4>
                  <h6>Grown mostly in Kharif and Rabi Season</h6>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='maize.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                     <p>* It is a crop which is used both as food
                      and fodder. <br>*It requires
                      temperature between 21°C to 27°C and grows
                      well in old alluvial soil. <br>
                      * It which requires high
                      temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity
                      with annual rainfall above 100 cm. <br>* Use of modern
                      inputs such as HYV seeds, fertilisers and irrigation
                      have contributed to the increasing production of
                      maize. </p><br><br>   
                  <h4>PULSES:</h4><h5>Tur(arhar),Urad,Moong</h5>
                  <h6>Grown mostly in Kharif and Rabi Season and even in Rainy season(Urad)</h6>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='tur.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='urad.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='moong.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                   <p>* Pulses
                    need less moisture and survive even in dry
                    conditions. <br>*Being leguminous crops, all these
                    crops except arhar help in restoring soil fertility
                    by fixing nitrogen from the air. Therefore, these
                    are mostly grown in rotation with other crops.
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h4>SUGARCANE:</h4>
                  <h6>Grown : Whole year</h6>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='sugarcane.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                     <p>*It is a tropical as well as a
                      subtropical crop. <br>*It grows well in hot and
                      humid climate with a temperature of 21°C to
                      27°C and an annual rainfall between 75cm.
                      and 100cm. <br>
                      * . Irrigation is required in the regions
                      of low rainfall. <br>* It can be grown on a variety of
                      soils and needs manual labour from sowing to
                      harvesting. India is the second largest producer
                      of sugarcane only after Brazil. <br>*It is the main
                      source of sugar, gur (jaggary), khandsari and
                      molasses.  </p><br><br>  
                  <h4>OIL SEEDS:</h4><h5>Groundnut,Coconut,Seasamum,Soyabean,Sunflower</h5>
                  <h6>Grown mostly in Kharif and Rabi Season and Sunflower is grown Whole year.</h6>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='groundnut.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='coconut.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>

                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='soyabean.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='sunflower.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                   <p>* Most of these are edible and used
                    as cooking mediums. However, some of these
                    are also used as raw material in the production
                    of soap, cosmetics and ointments.
                  </p><br><br>
                  <h4>COTTON:</h4>
                  <h6>Grown in Kharif and Rabi seasons</h6>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='cotton.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                     <p>India is believed to be the original
                      home of the cotton plant. Cotton is one of the
                      main raw materials for cotton textile industry. <br>
                      * . Irrigation is required in the regions
                      of low rainfall. <br>* Cotton grows well in drier
                      parts of the black cotton soil of the Deccan plateau. <br>*It requires high temperature, light
                      rainfall or irrigation, 210 frost-free days and
                      bright sun-shine for its growth. It requires 6 to 8 months to mature. </p><br><br> 
                  <h4>NIGER SEEDS:</h4>
                  <h6>Grown in Kharif season</h6>
                  <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='niger.jpg')}}" width="400" height="300"><br><br><br>
                     <p>Niger is a minor oilseed crop that is grown predominantly under rainfed conditions. <br>
                      * Sown under rained situations in kharif and rabi as a sole crop or mixed crop with little millet, finger millet, pearl millet, groundnut or pulse crops in different States. A rainfall of 1000 - 1300 mm is considered as optimum.
                      <br>* Niger requires moist soil to grow properly. Niger could be raised in wide range of soils from clay loam to sandy loam, sandy and gravel soil.
                      <br>* It grows well under light black soils or brownish loam with sufficient depth and on well drained heavy soils or rocky laterite soils. It can withstand slight alkalinity and salinity also.
